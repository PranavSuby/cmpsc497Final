All scripts are in the scripts folder. dataFormatting.py formats the data, preprocessing.py trains the model, and runModel.py runs the model. The latest model is saved in the models folder at checkpoint 1000.

The data file could not be added to this project, since it was too big. The file structure was a folder called data with two subfolders, raw and processed. Link for data is in the pdf.
